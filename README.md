# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analyst

This repository contains my solution to the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise for the Data Analyst position. The exercise involved working with unstructured JSON data, creating a structured relational data model, writing SQL queries, identifying data quality issues, and communicating the findings to a business stakeholder.

## Requirements and Tasks

The exercise consisted of the following requirements and tasks:

1. Review unstructured JSON data and diagram a new structured relational data model.
2. Generate a query that answers a predetermined business question.
3. Generate a query to capture data quality issues against the new structured relational data model.
4. Write a short email or Slack message to the business stakeholder.

## Solution

I have provided my approach and solutions in the attached notebook (ipynb file). The notebook outlines the steps I took to complete each task.

1. To create a structured relational data model, I first reviewed the unstructured JSON data and analyzed its structure. Based on this analysis, I designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram representing the relationships between different entities in the data.

2. I generated a SQL query to answer the predetermined business question. The query extracts the relevant data from the structured relational data model and provides the desired information.

3. In order to capture data quality issues, I developed a SQL query that identifies any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data. This query helps in ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the structured data model.

4. Lastly, I composed a short email or Slack message to the business stakeholder, summarizing the entire process, including the steps taken, the findings, and any obstacles encountered during the analysis.

Please refer to the notebook for a detailed explanation of my approach and the code used to solve each task.

## Instructions

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: pandas, sqlite3

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install pandas sqlite3
```

Once you have the prerequisites, open the notebook file (ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially to see the results.

Please note that the notebook assumes the presence of the provided unstructured JSON data file in the same directory.

## Conclusion

This coding exercise provided an opportunity to showcase my skills in data analysis, SQL querying, and data modeling. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this exercise and am confident that my solutions demonstrate my ability to reason about data and effectively communicate insights to findings.
